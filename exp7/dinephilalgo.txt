Step 1 Start
Step 2 Read the number of philosophers
Step 3 Create a mutex lock mutex and n semaphores for each philosopher
Step 4 Create n threads for phlosopher and pass its number as argument
Step 5 Join the threads
Step 6 When philosopher is running 
Step 6.1 Call take_fork with its number
Step 6.2 Call put_fork with its number
Step 7 When take_fork is running
Step 7.1 Lock the mutex
Step 7.2 Change the state of philosopher as HUNGRY from THINKING
Step 7.3 Test whether the state of left ad right philosophers are not EATING, if true
Step 7.3.1 Change the state of philosopher as EATING and change the state of semaphore of the philosopher       
Step 7.4 Unlock the mutex
Step 7.5 Change the state to wait of the semaphore of philosopher
Step 8 When put_fork is running
Step 8.1 Lock the mutex
Step 8.2 Change state of philosopher to THINKING
Step 8.3 Check whether the left and right philosopher are in HUNGRY state, if true
Step 8.3.1 Check their left and rigth are not in EATING state and if it is true make them EATING and change their semaphore state to post
Step 8.4 Unlock mutex
Step 9 Destroy mutex and semaphores
Step 10 Stop
