1 Start
2 Read number of processes n
3 Read arrival and burst time of all processes in p
4 Sort processes in arrival time order and copy to p1
5 Set wait time of process 0 p1[0].wt as 0 and i = 1
6 Repeat until i <n
6.1 Set t = arrival time p1[i-1].at + wait time p1[i-1].wt + burst time p1[i-1].bt
6.2 Check if p1[i].at<=t, set p1[i].wt = t - p1[i].at
6.3 Else , set p1[i].wt = 0
6.4 Increment i by 1
7 Set all wait time to the same in p from p1
8 Find turnaround time for each process by p[i].tt = p[i].bt + p[i].wt
9 Print all details
10 Find average wait time and turnaround time by taking average of each processes and print
11 Stop
