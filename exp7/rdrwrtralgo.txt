Step 1 Start
Step 2 Create semphore wrt and mutex lock mutex
Step 3 Initialise semaphore with 1 and count numreader as 0
Step 4 Create 10 threads for reader and call reader function with its number as its parameter
Step 5 Create 5 threads for writer and call writer function with its number as parameter
Step 6 Join the threads
Step 7 When reader is running
Step 7.1 Lock using mutex
Step 7.2 Increment numreader by 1
Step 7.3 If numreader is 1, if true 
Step 7.3.1 Call wait using semaphore,  then the writers will wait
Step 7.4 Unlock mutex
Step 7.5 Read the value in shared memory
Step 7.6 Lock
Step 7.7 Decrement numreader by 1
Step 7.8 If numreader is 0,
Step 7.8.1 Change the state wait of writers to post
Step 7.9 Unlock mutex
Step 8 When writer is running
Step 8.1 Put to wait using semaphore
Step 8.2 Modify the common value of shared memory
Step 8.3 Change the waiting state
Step 9 Destroy mutex and semaphore
Step 10 Stop
