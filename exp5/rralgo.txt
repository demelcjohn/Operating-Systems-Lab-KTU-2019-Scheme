1. Start
2. Read number of processes n
3. Read arrival and burst time of all processes
4. Sort processes according to arrival time and read the time quatum ts
5. Set remain = n, time = i =0
6. Repeat until remain becomes 0
6.1 Check if runtime of process i p[i].rnt <= ts and runtime greater than 0
6.1.1 Increment time by runtime of process i
6.1.2 Set runtime as 0 and flag as 1
6.1.3 Print process number and time for gantt chart
6.2 Else if runtime > 0
6.2.1 Set turnaround time of process i p[i].tt = time - arrival time p[i].at
6.2.2 Increment time by ts
6.2.3 Print process number and time for gantt chart
6.3 Check if runtime = 0 and flag =1, if true
6.3.1 Decrement remain by 1
6.3.2 Set p[i].tt = time - p[i].at
6.3.3 Set wait time p[i].wt = time - burst time p[i].bt
6.3.4 Set average wait time avgwt = avgwt + time -p[i].at-p[i].bt
6.3.5 Set average turnaround time avgtt = avgtt + time - p[i].at
6.3.6 Set flag = 0
6.4 Check i=n-1 ,if true set i=0
6.5 print average waiting time as avgwt = avgwt/n
6.6 print average waiting time as avgtt = avgtt/n
