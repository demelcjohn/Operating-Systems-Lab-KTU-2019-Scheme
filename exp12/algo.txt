Step 1 Start
Step 2 Input number of requests n and blocks to be 
       allocated rq
Step 3 Enter the choice
Step 4 If choice is 1, call fcfs()
Step 5 If choice is 2, call scan()
Step 6 If choice is 3, call cscan()
Step 7 If choice <= 3, go to step 3
Step 8 Stop

fsfc()

Step 1 Set totalswing = 0 and i = 0
Step 2 Repeat until i<n-1
Step 2.1 Set totalswing = totalswing + |rq[i]-rq[i+1|
Step 2.2 Increment i by 1
Step 3 Print rq is same order as execution order
Step 4 Print totalswing
Step 5 Return

scan()

Step 1 Set totalswing = 0
Step 2 Copy rq to sch
Step 3 Sort sch
Step 4 Find index of rq[0] in sch and copy to pos
Step 5 From pos copy all elements to the left in sch to sch1
Step 6 Add 0 to sch1
Step 7 Copy remaining elements in sch to sch1
Step 8 Add 200 to sch1
Step 9 Repeat until i<n
Step 9.1 Set totalswing = totalswing + |sch1[i]-sch1[i+1|
Step 9.2 Increment i by 1
Step 10 Print sch1 is same order as execution order
Step 11 Print totalswing
Step 12 Return

cscan()

Step 1 Set totalswing = 0
Step 2 Copy rq to sch
Step 3 Sort sch
Step 4 Find index of rq[0] in sch and copy to pos
Step 5 From pos copy all elements to the right in sch to sch1
Step 6 Add 200 and 0 in sch1
Step 7 Copy all elements in left side of sch to sch1 in 
       ascending order
Step 8 Repeat until i<n+1
Step 8.1 Check if sch1 !=200 or sch1 != 0, if true
Step 8.1.1Set totalswing = totalswing + |sch1[i]-sch1[i+1|
Step 8.2 Increment i by 1
Step 9 Print sch1 is same order as execution order
Step 10 Print totalswing
Step 11 Return
